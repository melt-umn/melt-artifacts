This artifact demonstrates the strategy attributes introduced in our
SLE paper "Strategic Tree Rewriting in Attribute Grammars."  These new
kinds of attributes allow rewriting strategies to be seamlessly
integrated into the attribute grammar formalism.  We demonstrate
strategy attributes in several examples, including optimizing a simple
expression language, evaluation of the lambda-calculus, regular
expression matching using Brzozowski derivatives, normalizing
for-loops in an ableC extensions, and in optimizing the implementation
of strategy attributes themselves.
