This artifact demonstrates the tree sharing mechanisms introduced in our
SLE paper "Sharing Trees and Contextual Information: 
Re-imagining Forwarding in Attribute Grammars."  These new
mechanisms allow for child trees to be shared
between extension productions and their forward translation.  
We demonstrate the use of these features in a simple example language
(based on the one used in examples in the paper),
and in a number of extensions to ableC.
The software included here corresponds to version 0.5.0 of Silver
and version 0.1.9 of ableC.
