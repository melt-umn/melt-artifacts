This artifact demonstrates the use of monadification in attribute
grammars, allowing us to use monads implicitly.  It shows how our
monadification scheme simplifies attribute equations, making them
clearer, while maintaining the same behavior.  It does this by giving
examples of attribute equations with and without using monads
implicitly, and showing that both versions evaluate the same, while
the equations using monads implicitly are much clearer.
