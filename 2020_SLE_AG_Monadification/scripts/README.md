# Instructions for building this artifact

The ``make-tarball`` script will collect the requisite files and run
Docker to create the container.
```
./make-tarball
```

The tar file should then be published on the http://melt.cs.umn.edu
website in the ``melt-artifacts`` directory.  It should be named
``2020_SLE_AG_Monadification.tar.gz`` to match the directory name
here.

(See http://melt.cs.umn.edu/melt-artifacts where I created 2 empty
files named in this manner.)
