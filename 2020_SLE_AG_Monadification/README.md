# Monadification of Attribute Grammars - software artifact

## For artifact evaluators

To evaluate this software artifact, please see the following
documents included in the artifact:

1. The [Getting-Started.md](Getting-Started.md) file has instructions on
   installing and testing the artifact to see that it can be run
   correctly on evaluators' computers.
2. The [Step-By-Step-Instructions.md](Step-By-Step-Instructions.md)
   file has instruction to walk though the examples to carry out the
   actual evaluation.

A copy of the submitted SLE paper is also included, it will be
replaced with the final version of the paper when it is complete.

Please note that the artifact download site is a temporary one.  Once
we have taken any feedback from the evaluators into account a final
version will be prepared and place in the Data Repository for the
University of Minnesota:
[https://conservancy.umn.edu/](https://conservancy.umn.edu/).  The
data and other artifacts placed here are archived by the University of
Minnesota libraries in perpetuity and are assigned digital object
identifier numbers (DOIs).  A previous software artifact for a paper
at OOPSLA is archived there now, with the DOI/url of
[https://doi.org/10.13020/D6VQ25](https://doi.org/10.13020/D6VQ25).
We will follow the same process for this artifact.  The DOI for it
will be included in the final version of our paper. If the evaluators
would like to see this done sooner so that the "artifact available"
badge can be assigned we would be happy to do so.  Please let us know
if a DOI is needed now to acquire this badge.
