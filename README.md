# Software artifacts for the MELT group

This repository contains the scripts and instructions for creating
software artifacts that are often evaluated alongside papers submitted
to conferences like OOPSLA and SLE.

Each artifact has its own directory and that directory serves as the
home page for the artifact. When viewed through a web-browser it can
be used as a reasonably nice way to render the MarkDown files that are
the instruction for artifact evaluators.
